                            My name is Devam, and I'm a Computer Science student at the Georgia Institute of
                            Technology
                            interested in the intersection of machine learning and other disciplines. Throughout my past
                            experiences, whether be internships or research positions, I have developed strong technical
                            skills while forging an ability to communicate the business value of complex systems. This
                            drives me to the intersection of research engineering and entrepreneurship; I envision
                            myself
                            making research more practical. I am actively searching for Summer 2025 internships, so
                            please
                            feel free to reach out with any opportunities @ dmondal9@gatech.edu or
